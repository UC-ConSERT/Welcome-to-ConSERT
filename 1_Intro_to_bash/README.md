# The Command Line
## An efficient way to use a computer
For most day-to-day applications we use a GUI to ineract with software and complete tasks on a computer. However, the command line offers an efficient means to perform and automate tasks. For example, say you wanted to rename 20 files sharing a similar naming syntax in a directory. If you had to rename each one using the GUI this task would be time intensive and potentially frustrating. In contrast, using the command line these same files could quickly be renamed with a single line of code. 

Another important reason to invest in learning the command line is that many bioinformatic programmes can only be used in the command line. Although the initial stages of memorising specific commands and their syntax may be dauting, it is an essential skill on your journey to analysing genomic data.
