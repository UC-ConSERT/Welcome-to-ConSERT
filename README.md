# Welcome to ConSERT - A brief introduction
Kia ora and welcome the the Conservation, Systematics and Evolution Research Team repository! Here, we have a brief introduction to the command line interface (CLI), data carpentry, data management, and bioinformatic tools commonly used in this group.

This information is freely available to members of ConSERT and readily available for modification as bioinformatic approaches/practices inevitably change overtime. We're also open to and welcome feedback on how this documentation. :fire:

It is important to note that the information provided in this repository is simply to provide brief introduction to concepts and practices you'll likely use as a member of our group. It is NOT intended to serve as the only resource you would want to access and is designed to be reviewed as a group or alongside a more experienced lab member. As a general rule, this material can be seen as a starting point for your own learning. Therefore we aim to point folks in the general direction of useful and informative external resources that will cover this material thoroughly and in more detail than outlined here. Links to these suggested resources for additional learning will be made available within each directory. :smiley:

Below is a overview of each of the directories in this repository. To get started on any particular topic, head to the relevant directory above or click on the links provided below.

## 1) Genotyping by Sequencing quality control and preliminary analyses
If you're working with genotyping-by-sequence data (GBS), [here](https://github.com/UC-ConSERT/Welcome-to-ConSERT/tree/main/1_GBS_script_templates) we provide some template scripts for running the STACKS pipeline. We outline steps for pre-processing and trimming your reads, and the next steps for either genome alignment or an alignment free approach to SNP discovery.

## 2) Whole genome resequence data quality control and preliminary analyses
If you're working with Illumina resequence data, [here](https://github.com/UC-ConSERT/Welcome-to-ConSERT/tree/main/2_Illumina_WGS_script_templates) we provide template scripts for quality control of reads, alignment to a reference genome and quality metrics.
